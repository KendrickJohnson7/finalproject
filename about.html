        <h1>Story</h1>
        <p> Hello I'm Kendrick Johnson, I have many different talents but the ones I highlight are basketball, designing, and my social awareness. Designing clothes to me is something that is overlooked and underrated. Growing up, my fascination with art defined my perspective on clothing. From a young age, I viewed clothing not just as fabric, but as a canvas awaiting creative expression. Each piece of clothing I encountered sparked my imagination—I saw potential to provide it with unique touches, transforming ordinary pieces into extraordinary fashion statements. Fashion became my escape place with endless opportunities and no boundaries. It not only gave me joy but it gave me so much freedom in my life and I enjoy producing that into the world. This passion led me to constantly innovate, blending new elements and ideas seamlessly into unique pieces. The pieces that I make are uniquely produced by the care and great condition that it takes to package and send off.</p>
